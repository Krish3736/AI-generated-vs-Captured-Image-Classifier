AI-GENERATED VS CAPTURED-IMAGE CLASSIFIER

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and efficient system that can identify whether an image is AI-generated or real. 
This involves Collecting and preparing a diverse dataset of AI-generated and real images.
Training a prebuilt deep learning model to classify these images accurately.
Creating a user-friendly interface using Gradio for easy image upload and classification.
Evaluating the model's performance and refining it to achieve high accuracy.
